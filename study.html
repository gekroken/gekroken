     		<h2 class="headline"> Abstract <h2>

     <p class="studyp">

The main objective of this study, was to evaluate digital brand engagement regarding city branding through the online media platform Instagram. The two cities that  were examined, analyzed and compared are Paris and Dubai. This is interesting because in this fashion the scope of a traditional brand is elaborated, hence the places are also a product, and because of it, a brand. 
According to Iconosquare, an online platform that tracks Instagram data, Paris and Dubai belong to the top ten strongest brand identities. 

 </p>

 <p class="studyp">
Continuing with the objective of this study, this research will try to visualize how brands engage with the consumer and how the consumers engage with the brand. 

Conclusion about the brand engagement strategy in Instgram for both brands will be made and further recommendation for marketer ellaborated.

<h2 class="headline">Introduction </h2>
<p class="studyp">In this research the similarities and differences between types of city brand engagement of Dubai and Paris by Instagram users are investigated. Through this research the effective methods and techniques of city brand engagement, with regards to social media, are identified. With typologies deduced from academic references, each Instagram engagement was analyzed and categorized. By using the application program interfaces (API’s) of both cities, the scalability is measured and the consumer engagement of the cities are realized. The official Instagram accounts of the cities are also explored, acquiring information from the brands’ side and how they engage their consumers. Us, a team of young proffesionals, will apply our understanding and expertise in order to draw conclusions and recommendations from the found results.
</p>


<h2 class="headline">Theoretical Framework</h2>
<p class="studyp">The study of Brodie, et al. (2013) applies a netnographic methodology, which is qualitative research based on an ethnographic methodology, but then applied to communities that are located online. It analyses unique phases of engagement which are main and sub processes (learning, sharing, advocating, socializing and co-developing) relating to online brand communities. In addition, the levels of engagement are determined by emotional, behavioral and cognitive variables, in which there exists a positive relationship between emotional engagement and behavioral/cognitive engagement. This model is applied in researching 

Coursaris, et al. (2013) researched strategic consumer engagement with regards to classifying brand facebook page messages. What was noticeable in this study was that both the researcher and the users were considered. Furthermore they make a connection between the different dimensions in SM, the messages and the genres they belong too. Coursaris, et al. (2013) applied a framework in which different types of engagement were described, for this research this typology was applied in segmenting the enagement on the online platform InstaGram. The variables that were extracted from this research study and applied for this research were:
</p>
<br>
<p class="title">
Promotions, heritage, awareness, openings, community, appreciation, holiday and event.
</p>
<br>
<p class="studyp">
In the article Digital Junk, Freeman, et al. (2014) apply another model concerning tyology which is utilized for this research as well. The variables that were extracted from this study and were applied as typology for this research were:
</p>
<br>
<p class="title">
User-generated-content (USG), celebrities and sponsorship or partnership.
</p>
<br>
<p class="studyp">
The academic references on which the typologies in this study are based on, come from Brodie, et al., Cursaris et al., & Freeman et al. All conribute to the list of typologies used as they are deducted from their individual studies. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="headline">Methodology</h2>
<p class="studyp">
The methodology for this research allows for both the consumer side and brand side to be investigated regarding Paris and Dubai.
Secondary data provided through the API dataset allows access to hashtag behaviour by Instagram users who engage Paris and/ or Dubai in their posts. The generated data contains data in the timeframe of 30-31 May 2016 and represents the consumers' interaction with both Paris and Dubai. A sample was conducted from this data, covering the 100 top liked posts and the 20 least liked posts per city, making it a total of 200 top posts and 40 least liked posts. This way the differences and similarities between high engagement posts and low engagement post can be compared.
</p>
<br>
<p class="studyp">
In addition, data was selected from the media platform Instagram itself. In doing so two accounts were selected for both cities, in which one account represents the tourist office and the other represents the city office. This way the brands' digital engagement with its consumers can be analyzed, and the image they want to project and market to the world about their city.
The accounts for Paris were: 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<ul class="content2">
   <li>@paris_maville (City Office)</li><br>
   <li>@parisjetaime (Official Tourist Office)</li><br>
</ul>

<br>
<p class="studyp">
The accounts for Dubai were: 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<ul class="content2">
   <li>@dubai (City Office)</li><br>
   <li>@visitdubai (Official Tourist Office)</li><br>
</ul>
<br>

<p class="studyp">
For all four accounts the most recent 50 posts were studied and analyzed. The Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) are based on the available metrics of the total number of customer interactions, that were used to calculate the engagement rate are:
</p>
<br>
<br>
<ul class="content2">
   <li>number of likes</li><br>
   <li>number of comments</li><br>
   <li>media type</li><br>
   <li>most popular key words in comments and titles (tag cloud)</li><br>
   <li>engagement typology</li><br>
</ul>
<br>

<p class="studyp">
Subsequently, the engagement rate for each post was calculated to gain quantitative insight into this research. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="studyp">
The formula used to calculate the engagement rate per post in each brand (Paris and Dubai) was: 
</p>
<br>

<p class="formula">
Engagement rate = (likes + comments) / followers / number of posts x100%
</p>
<br>

<p class="studyp">
So far the above research has established two perspectives to be examined, how do brands engage with consumers and how consumers engage with brands. In total 100 posts were extracted per city (2 IG accounts per city) which is why 200 posts were taken from the API data to create consistency within the data of the research. 
</p>
<br>
<br>

<p class="studyp">
Next, each post was categorized on its typology by the researchers on the basis of the typology sheet by the before mentioned authors. In order to ensure intercoder realiability each post was categorized by two researchers, who must agree on the chosen typology for each post. As the Instagram platform allows for regrams to be posted, this was also the case in the posts by all 4 Instagram accounts. These fall under the typology of User Generated Content (CGC). In order to differentiate these posts from each other to get more concrete and detailed results, subcategories were made based on the most common trends in all posts.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="studyp">
The UCG consists of: 
</p>
<br>
<ul class="content2">
   <li>Skyline/ Building</li><br>
   <li>Sports</li><br>
   <li>Art/ Culture</li><br>
   <li>Landscape</li><br>
   <li>Event</li><br>
   <li>Food</li><br>
</ul>
<br>

<p class="studyp">
Comparing the amount of comments and like in different accounts we also realised how much the quality of those comments varies from group to group and that none of the tools we used in our study gave us a proper picture of the quality of engagement. That lead us to overall analysis of brands’ goals and strategy and the quality results of feedback loops they lead to. 
</p>
<br>

<p class="studyp">
Following this, the quality of the users’ comments to posts to the quantity of posts were compared to see how users react to different ways of brand engagement strategies. In order to do so we took a look at mentioned accounts’ tactics and learned that different accounts of the same brand have different goals on Instagram. To support this hypothesis we took 1 post of each account in order to analyze the way consumers engage with different types of brands’ behavior.  As a standard of “quality comment” (QC) a comment with more than 1 word not including tags and emoticons was set as a benchmark to all other comments. As “spam” users we understand accounts with promotional marketing value or with content that is irrelevant to the topics and ideas of the brand, therefore, does not correspond with the brand’s target audience. Finally, the generated Instagram dataset and the API hashtag dataset was compared.
</p>
<br>

<h2 class="headline">Research Limitations</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p class="studyp">
There are certain limitations present when comparing both datasets (API and official Instagram pages):
</p>
<br>
<br>
<ul class="content2">
   <li>Both data sets belong to different time periods. The API data that was extracted covers exlusively the 30th and 31st of May. Whereas, the analysed data from the IG accounts covers the 50 most recent posts. Hence, this restricts comparing the data to a full extent. However, analysing data that cover a wider time span gives more internal insight regarding the engagement because the API data is basically a snapshot.</li><br>
   <li>Due to lack of time not all posts could be analyzed and so the latest 50 post were extracted for analysis, also interfering with the random sampling method.</li><br>
   <li>The 100 most liked posts from the API data were selected to examine the posts that were most engaged with, and the 20 least liked posts were selected to create a balance, however this balance is not equal and still limits the random sampling method.</li><br>
   <li>While analyzing the quality of comments in each group, the most commented post for every group was chosen due to lack of time.</li>
   <br> 
   <li>Posts that were previously accesible, are now not available anymore, bringing inconsistency to the number of posts per city we were able to analyze. In total this was 12.1% for Paris and 8% for Dubai.</li><br>
   <li>Because a city is not a concrete product which you can buy, and it is a continuous changing environement, the findings do not necessarilly have to be applicable in a different time frame. For example, within Paris many posts were related to the Euro Cup. </li>
   <br>
  </ul>
